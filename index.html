      <h2>McLaren F1</h2>
      <p>
        The McLaren F1 is an iconic supercar that remains a symbol of automotive
        excellence and engineering prowess. Introduced in 1992, it was a marvel
        of its time, and it continues to be celebrated for its innovation and
        performance. The brainchild of legendary designer Gordon Murray, the F1
        was renowned for its unique three-seater configuration, with the
        driver's seat positioned centrally for an unparalleled driving
        experience. Powering this masterpiece is a 6.1-liter naturally aspirated
        V12 engine developed by BMW, which produced a staggering 627 horsepower,
        propelling the F1 to a top speed of over 240 miles per hour, making it
        the fastest production car of its era. Constructed with an obsession for
        lightweight materials, including a carbon fiber monocoque chassis, the
        McLaren F1 set a new standard for supercar design. Its rarity and
        historical significance have only enhanced its status as a true
        automotive legend, sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike.

      <h2>Koenigsegg CCXR</h2>
      <p>
        The Koenigsegg CCXR is a high-performance supercar produced by the
        Swedish manufacturer Koenigsegg. It was introduced in 2007 as an
        evolution of the CCX model. The "R" in CCXR stands for "Race,"
        indicating its track-focused capabilities. One of the distinctive
        features of the CCXR is its ability to run on E85 ethanol fuel, in
        addition to regular gasoline. This flexibility allows for increased
        power output, as ethanol has a higher octane rating. The CCXR is powered
        by a 4.7-liter V8 engine with twin superchargers, producing incredible
        horsepower and torque figures, resulting in blistering acceleration and
        top speeds. With its lightweight construction and aerodynamic design,
        the Koenigsegg CCXR is a true hypercar known for its performance and
        exclusivity.

        Doctor Stephen Strange is a fictional character appearing in American
        comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Steve Ditko with Stan
        Lee, the character first appeared in Strange Tales #110 (cover-dated
        July 1963). Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary
        protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats. Strange was
        created during the Silver Age of Comic Books to bring a different kind
        of character and themes of mysticism to Marvel Comics. The character
        starts as a brilliant but egotistically arrogant neurosurgeon whose
        hands get injured in a car accident. Because his hands have severe nerve
        damage from the accident, he is told that current medical therapy and
        rehabilitation would not be enough to enable him to practice again as a
        surgeon. Unable to accept this prognosis, he starts to travel the world
        searching for alternative ways of healing, which leads him to the
        Ancient One, the Sorcerer Supreme.
